# Biography

Hello there!
I'm Jacob Buckman, a 2017-2018 Google AI Resident.
My research is focused on deep learning, specializing in natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
I'm interested in how artificial agents can learn to understand their environment, and how that knowledge can be effectively communicated to other agents.
