# Biography

Hello there!
I'm Jacob Buckman, currently a Google AI Resident in San Francisco.
My research is focused on deep learning, especially natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
I'm interested in how artificial agents can learn to understand their environment and how that knowledge can be effectively communicated to others.
